# Code_Quiz

```
In this project I have created a multiple choice quiz using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The assignment includes feature we learnt thus far, such as:

> Using interval timer
> Adding event listners and triggering functions 
> Navigating to a different HTML page
> Using local storage
> If/Else loops
> Creating, adding, and manipulating HTML elements dynamically.

```

## Application Features

```
The application presents the user with 5 multiple choice questions to be answered in less that 75 secs. Am incorrect answer results in a 10 sec penalty. 
Once the user answers all the questions, the user is presented an option to enter their initials to save the score. 
The user is then presented a High Scores page which lists all of the high scores.
The user has ability to clear the high-scores, or go back to the quiz. 
Please note that the application is best viewwed in Google Chrome and is designed to be resppnsive.
