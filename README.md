# Code_Quiz

```
In this project I have created a multiple choice quiz using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
The assignment includes features we learnt thus far, such as:

> Using interval timer
> Adding event listners and triggering functions 
> Navigating to a different HTML page
> Using local storage
> If/Else loops
> Creating, adding, and manipulating HTML elements dynamically.

```

## Application Features

```
> The application presents the user with 5 multiple choice questions to be answered in less that 75 secs. 
> An incorrect answer results in a 15 sec penalty. 
> The user can enter their initials and save the score after all questions are answered. 
> The user is then presented a High Scores page which lists all of the high scores.
> The user has ability to clear the high-scores, or go back to the quiz. 
> Please note that the application is best viewwed in Google Chrome and is designed to be responsive. 


```
